# DeFioptions
In this repository you can find a full dApp project on the American-style Call and Put options </br>
Project is the dApp, with smart-contract code for options written in Solidity and front-end written in (Vue, JS, HTML, CSS, Web3.js)</br>
dApp testing was done on Truffle, Ganache. </br>

Currently I have included two types of options:
  1. American-style covered collateralized call options
  2. American-style collateralized put options

For the purpose of testing I have also created ERC20 token "CleverWizardToken".</br>
You can use this token to test the option contracts.</br>
Since this contracts have not gone through security audits yet, please use them at your own risk.
